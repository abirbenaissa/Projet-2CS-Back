# Projet-2CS-Back
RENTED is our second year of the second cycle in ECOLE SUPERIEURE EN INFORMATIQUE 08 MAI 1945, SIDI BEL ABBES project.
And it is a website that represent an online community connects people looking for accommodation with people who wanna rent their homes. 
it has multiple advantages comparing to the old methods thanks to its security and confidentiality.
The strong point of RENTED is the safety and confidence, the people who want to rent their homes will receive a check-up visit to confirm their offer. 
We used micro-services architecture to help isolate multiple services and improve scalability in the future. 
build with Node.js /express.js , mongodb/mongoose in the back-end , React js,Redux,chakra ui in the front-end,
and spring cloud gateway to manage the orchestration between them easily . 
Supported by a recommendation system to improve the user experience by recommending for him locations using the KNN algorithm 
,we used in that the raccoon.js engine and costumed version of redis database .
